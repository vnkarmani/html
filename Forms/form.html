    <h1>Html Form</h1>
    <p>An HTML form is used to collect user input.</p>
    <p>The user input is sent to a server for processing.</p>
    <p>The HTML &lt;form> element is used to create an HTML form for user input</p>
    <p>&lt;form>----&lt;/form></p>
    <p>The &lt;form> element is a container for different types of input elements, such as: text fields, checkboxes,
        radio
        buttons, submit buttons, etc.</p>

    <p><strong>Form attributes:</strong></p>

    <p><b>1.Action</b></p>
    <p>The "action" attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.</p>
    <p>Usually, the form data is sent to a file on the server when the user clicks on the submit button.</p>
    <p> the form data is sent to a file which we write through "action" attribute.</p>

    <p><b>2.Method</b></p>
    <p>The method attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data.</p>
    <p>The default HTTP method when submitting form data is GET.</p>
    <p>the form data sent to the URL when we use GET method,so get method is less secure.</p>
    <p>using GET method,the submitted data is visible on url</p>
    <p>in GET method,The length of a URL is limited.</p>
    <p>GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google.</p>
    <p>using POST method,,the submitted data is not visible on url.</p>
    <p>in POST method,The length of a URL is not limited(unlimited),so it is used to send large amounts of data</p>
    <p>POST method is more secure then GET.</p>
    <p>So,Always use POST if the form data contains sensitive or personal information.</p>

    <p><b>3.Autocomplete</b></p>
    <p>The autocomplete attribute specifies whether a form should have autocomplete on or off.</p>
    <p>When autocomplete is on, the browser automatically complete values based on values that the user has entered
        before.</p>
    <p>by dedault,its value is off.</p>

    <p><b>4.nonvalidate</b></p>
    <p>When  nonvalidate is present, it specifies that the form-data (input) should not be validated when submitted.</p>

    <p><b>5.enctype</b></p>
    <p>it Specifies how the form-data should be encoded when submitting it to the server.</p>
    <p>it is used only for POST method.</p>
