                    <p>What’s better than having a crispy melty pizza, you ask?<br><br>
                        Having that crispy and melty pizza in the comfort of your own home with the ones you love, we
                        say<br><br>
                        With Domino's it is always “Rishton ka time”. Whether it's a treat for your promotion, a kid
                        topping his class or winning the heart of your wife who is too tired to cook after a long day at
                        work! A cheesy slice of the best pizza is all one needs to put things into perspective and start
                        any celebration. Plus, you do not even need to rush to the restaurant to have one now. A call, a
                        few clicks on our website or a few touches on the mobile screen is all you have to do to have
                        that tempting, light-on-the-pocket pizza at your doorstep.<br><br>
                        There is something for everyone here. The vegetarians, non-vegetarians, the sides’ lovers and
                        also the ones who love to have something sweet by the time they reach the last bite of the last
                        slice of pizza slice.<br><br>
                        <b>What We Need - More Choice. More Fun.</b><br><br>
                        No matter what the situation, pizza always helps. Especially a pizza that gives you the freedom
                        to choose your toppings - from paneer, crisp capsicum, onion, grilled mushroom, golden corn,
                        black olives, fresh tomato, red paprika, jalapeno, paneer tikka and extra cheese to non-veg
                        toppings such as pepper barbeque chicken, peri-peri chicken, grilled chicken rasher, chicken
                        sausage or chicken tikka- the options are almost endless, anything and everything you can think
                        of that too on top of the crust of your choice - New hand-tossed crust, wheat thin crust, cheese
                        burst crust, classic hand-tossed crust or a fresh pan pizza. Because just like a pizza, Domino's
                        understands you.

                        And to shoo away those end-of-the-month blues while placing your order with our pizza
                        restaurant, check out the everyday pizzas from pizza mania combos with everyday value offer of 2
                        pizzas starting at just ₹99 (regular size) and ₹199 (medium size) each.<br><br>
                        <b>The Promise Of 30-Minute Delivery</b><br><br>
                        The icing on the cake or more aptly the extra cheese on your already fabulous pizza is that
                        Domino’s takes only half an hour for its pizza delivery service. Don’t believe us? Time it if
                        you please. With 1250+ stores present all over India, you can have a Domino’s pizza even while
                        traveling on a train. Yes, you are reading it right, you can enjoy pizza on train too.

                        So stop googling for the “pizza shops near me” and order from your nearest pizza outlet to have
                        a hot box of pizza on your table in the next 30 minutes, or berth at the next halting
                        station.<br><br>

                        We have come across a few instances of fraudsters posing as Jubilant FoodWorks and asking for

                        email id mentioned above. Anyone dealing with such fraudsters shall be doing so on their own
