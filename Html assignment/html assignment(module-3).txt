2.How to embed audio and video in a webpage?
ANS==>The HTML5 <audio> and <video> tags make it simple to add media to a website. You need to set src attribute to identify the media source and include a controls attribute so the user can play and pause the media.
    1.<video> element:
    -The <video> element allows us to embed video files into an HTML, very similar to the way images are embedded.
    -"src"-This attribute stands for the source, which is very similar to the src attribute used in the image element. We will add the link to a video file in the src attribute.
    -"type"-This is going to be video/mp4 because .mp4 is the format of the video we are using. We can also use different video formats like .ogg or .webm, then the value of type attribute will change to video/ogg or video/WebM respectively.
    -"control"-We will have to add controls manually by using the controls attribute to our video element. it can either be true or false.
    -"autoplay"-if we remove the controls we could also make the video autoplay, by using the autoplay attribute. it can either be true or false.
    -We can also have controls and autoplay together.
    
  example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Click play button to play video</h2>
<video src="./test.mp4" controls="true" autoplay="true"></video>
</body>
</html>

     2.<audio> element:
    -The <audio> element is very similar to the video element. However, the only major difference is that there are no visuals. 
    -We can use the audio element to play an audio file on our web page — such as an mp3 file.
    -in audio element The value in type attribute is changed from “video/mp4” to “audio/mp3”. In the src attribute, we’ve changed from a video file with .mp4 extension to an audio file with .mp3 extension.
    -Now, just like the video element, we won’t actually be able to stop or start the audio without any controls. So, we will be adding the controls attribute to the audio element.
    -we can also add other attributes in the <audio> element like autoplay, loop etc. it can either be true or false.
    
     example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Click play button to play audio</h2>
<audio src="./test.mp3" controls="true" autoplay="true"></audio>
</body>
</html>
